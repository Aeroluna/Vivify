# Vivify

*Bring your map to life.*

Vivify allows mappers to compile an AssetBundle, then load, instantiate, and manipulate custom-made assets using in-game events. These assets include post-processing shaders, 3D models, audio files, textures, and pretty much anything else that can be compiled into an asset bundle.
